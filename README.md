# Dijkstras-shortest-path-graph

This program's function is to implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm using a min heap data structure. When given a source-destination pair, the program will compute the shortest path from the source to the destination, and output the result as required. Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm uses a min-heap
of the vertices of the graph, where the key value at a node is the currently known distance from the source to the given node.
