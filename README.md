# Dijkstras-shortest-path-graph

This program's function is to implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm using a min heap data structure. The program will read in a graph, and build the edge adjacency list of the graph. The edge adjacency list is an array (indexed by the vertices) of singularly linked lists, where the list according to a node v denotes the outgoing neighbors of node v. When given a source-destination pair, the program will compute the shortest path from the source to the destination, and output the result as required. Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm uses a min-heap of the vertices of the graph, where the key value at a node is the currently known distance from the source to the given node.
